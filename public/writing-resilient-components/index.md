I really liked this picture, its by Van gogh. It's because when I see this picture it reminds me of my mortality. I think about how I will die one day. I think about how the world will move on without me and how my loved ones will eventually forget me. It's a sobering thought, but it's also a reminder to live life to the fullest and appreciate every moment. Tryna change evrything around me. I will use my every living moment to the fullest. Felt like making my country great again :)
