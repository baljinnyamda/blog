One of my closest friends got married, and I had the honor of standing beside him as his best man. Watching him promise forever to someone he loves... it hit differently. And for a brief moment, I looked at that joy and thought, maybe, someday, happiness like that will find me too.

It was one of those rare times I felt truly happy for someone else deeply, genuinely. No envy. Just pure joy.
Sheeeeeeeeeeee im running marathon tomorrow, bit tired, not gonna lie but weirdly, I feel like I'm at my strongest. My fullest. But also so chaotic blend of exhaustion and energy. Uncertainty and hope.

I’ve been trying everything lately. Writing poetry. Building software. Taking chances. Chasing ideas. Failing. Starting again. I don’t have everythiong. but, I’ve got stories. And I’m still writing them.

Another late night thoughts, the quiet dreams, and the wild, stubborn hope that one day, everything’s gonna be okay.

:)

cya another day with another story.
