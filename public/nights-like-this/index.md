Was out for a late walk, just minding my business, and boom this little legend pops up.
Fella was enjoying the bench little too much as if he pays rent there.
I sat down. We didnot talk much. We didnt have to as he was chewing one sth.

Our little fella reminded me of my dear friend. The real OG, the chosen one, the puker on a coach, ze (the) Zairmag. Looks pretty similar to me. Don't u think they look similar ?
