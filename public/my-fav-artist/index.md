So basically, this week been prettty busy. I had to do code a lot of stuff, like work and hobby and hanging out with some friends and yeah mostly thats it.
Oh, while I was reading a bloomberg this morning, noticed one interesting thing on Mongolian stock exchange, there is a company that had return of 18% only on dividends. I mean, that is pretty crazy, right? I mean, I don't know much about stocks and stuff, but that seems like a lot. Aaand that rockstar is `MSE:KHAN` (Khanbank). I mean, I don't know if it is a good idea to invest in it, but I think I will do some research on it. If you have any ideas, let me know. FYI: Their stock price did not change much from last year.

Also just wanted to random song, thats from my fav underground artist, who is not that popular.
